	abstract = {Ampliconic genes are good candidates for speciation genes: they are testis-expressed, multicopy and localized on sex chromosomes. Moreover, copy number variation in a specific ampliconic gene pair (Slx and Sly) is involved in hybrid incompatibilities between M. musculus and M. domesticus. However, we know little about the distribution of the ampliconic genes copy number and their turnover in human populations. Here we explore the evolution of human X- and Y-linked ampliconic genes by investigating copy number variation (CNV) and coding variation between populations using the Simons Genome Diversity Project. We develop a method to assess CNVs using the read-depth on modified X and Y chromosome targets containing only one repetition of each ampliconic gene. Our results reveal extensive standing variation in copy number both within and between human populations for several ampliconic genes. For the Y chromosome, we can infer multiple independent amplifications and losses of these gene copies even within closely related Y haplogroups, that diversified less than 50,000 years ago. For the X chromosome, we also find high copy number and coding diversity within populations. While we cannot rule out that neutral processes are at the origin of this high diversity, this study gives insights on the distribution of copy number within human populations, and demonstrates an extremely fast turnover in copy number of these regions.},
